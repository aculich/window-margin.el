Commentary:

This minor mode will automatically resize windows to the width of
the fill-column, or optionally to some fixed size set with the
window-margin-width variable.

To enable it with text-mode use:

  (add-hook 'text-mode 'turn-on-window-margin-mode)

This minor mode was inspired by reading an entry on StackOverflow

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14009223/set-column-width-for-visual-lines-in-emacs

when I discovered that (the quirky, but useful) longlines-mode was
being discontinued. I can't claim that this mode will be any less
quirky (probably moreso at this early 0.1 release), but it makes
use of margins and visual-line mode which is better way to
accomplish the effect than implemented by longlines-mode
